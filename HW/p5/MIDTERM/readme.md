## MIDTERM


### Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
I am making this project because I really love working on Illustrator and i thought this picture of me was very clear and easy to work with. It's also my personal signature/logo so I wanted to make it unique and fun to look at but also play with.


### What are your inputs?
My inputs are my points on my face that allow to have the hover effect of the different color patches and another input is my button at the top of my image

### What are your outputs?
My outputs are the different color patches imported from Illustrator as different layers and also the background image of myself

### Who is the target audience for your project?
The target audience for my project is anyone really. There isn't a specific type of person I am targeting as it is a simple, interactive graphic work that anyone can mess around with.

### Where will your project be displayed?
My project can be as simple as a link that people can reach or it can go further and potentially become a very big interactive screen where it would become tactile.
