## FINAL


### Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
I am making this project because I was trying to think of something that really passionated me and the first thing that came to my mind was definitely music. I used to always love looking at the iTunes visualizer and always been fascinated by movement and music - so I decided to make my own beat visualizer - something that could be both interactive and enjoyable to look at.

### What are your inputs?
My inputs are the if statements and curated color palettes for the random changes.


### What are your outputs?
My first output is the Mic sound library that i added in - this asset is crucial for my project and the way it works. Another output is the patterns created on illustrator for the visualizer.


### Who is the target audience for your project?
The target audience for my project is anyone really. It is a simple yet eye catching and interactive design that allows the most simple output - like a clap or even just talking close to the mic of the device that will allow it to generate a visual - which i think anyone would be able to do! So there is no specific audience for this as it could work for a toddler as well as an elderly person.


### Where will your project be displayed?
I think i am going to display this project (if i like it enough) on my portfolio website in order to include something interactive that shows my coding and UX/UI skills.
