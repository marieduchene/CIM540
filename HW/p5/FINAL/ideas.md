## FINAL

###IDEAS
My initial 3 big ideas all had something to do with sound - I mostly wanted to do something with music but I wanted to do something that was sort of a music visualizer at first. My first inspiration was the iTunes visualizer - I wanted to recreate something like that but less fluid and with more geometrical shapes. At first, I was going to make it so the visuals go with the beat and soundwaves - but then I discovered the mic sound plug in that allows the shapes to change with the microphone and code a certain threshold of the sound intensity hitting a visual.
This was my first inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6T6e1kPMNo
This was my main inspiration that lead to my actual project idea: https://therewasaguy.github.io/p5-music-viz/demos/01d_beat_detect_amplitude/
and for the shapes, instead of doing geometrical in the end, i added emojis and icons because I thought it was much more fun!


### Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
I am making this project because I was trying to think of something that really passionated me and the first thing that came to my mind was definitely music. I used to always love looking at the iTunes visualizer and always been fascinated by movement and music - so I decided to make my own beat visualizer - something that could be both interactive and enjoyable to look at.

### What are your inputs?
My inputs are the if statements and curated color palettes for the random changes.


### What are your outputs?
My first output is the Mic sound library that i added in - this asset is crucial for my project and the way it works. Another output is the patterns created on illustrator for the visualizer.


### Who is the target audience for your project?
The target audience for my project is anyone really. It is a simple yet eye catching and interactive design that allows the most simple output - like a clap or even just talking close to the mic of the device that will allow it to generate a visual - which i think anyone would be able to do! So there is no specific audience for this as it could work for a toddler as well as an elderly person.


### Where will your project be displayed?
I think i am going to display this project (if i like it enough) on my portfolio website in order to include something interactive that shows my coding and UX/UI skills.
