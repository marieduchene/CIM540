I am Marie. I'm 21 years old and I'm from Brussels, Belgium. I was born and raised there and moved to Miami for my undergrad studies in 2014. My major is creative advertising and my minor is interactive media. I love graphic design. I am graduating this spring and hopefully moving to New York after to work in the design industry.

#### The Tinder for Clothes app

This app allows for people to be able to "match" with needs and wants in terms of apparel. It works in a distance radius system where the app will detect who wants what and who is selling something that could correspond to someone in terms of clothes. If someone is close to someone else and is selling let's say a shirt that someone declared they had been looking for on the app, it will send them a push notification for them to be able to buy (swipe left) or ignore (swipe right)
